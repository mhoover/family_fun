# Family fun
## Introduction
At the holidays, who doesn't need a little 'magic' to entertain the younger family members? This repo has a simple tic-tac-toe game that should entertain a 5-year-old for maybe 3-4 minutes. ;)

## Basics
Adjust the `name_ages` dictionary in `__init__.py` file with the correct age/name mappings for your family (the ones in there now are just placeholders). Games should execute correctly and allow for either the human or computer to win and correctly identify if there is a tie match. Note, the computer moves are pretty simplistic and not likely to lead to a computer win, so this should be great with the younger ones in helping them to win.

## Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a classic game of tic-tac-toe. Select the number you want and an 'X' will be placed in lieu of that number. Then the computer will go. Keep playing until you, or the computer, wins. Ties are possible.

## Connect Four
This uses the classic 7x6 board for Connect Four. You'll be X's and the computer will be O's. You'll need to get four X's in a row to win, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Ties are allowed.
