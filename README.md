# Family fun
## Introduction
At the holidays, who doesn't need a little 'magic' to entertain the younger family members? This repo has a simple tic-tac-toe game that should entertain a 5-year-old for maybe 3-4 minutes. ;)

## Tic-tac-toe
Adjust the `name_ages` dictionary in `__init__.py` file with the correct age/name mappings for your family (the ones in there now are just placeholders). Game should execute correctly and allow for either the human or computer to win and correctly identify if there is a tie match.

Note, the computer moves are pretty simplistic and not likely to lead to a computer win, so this should be great with the younger ones in helping them to win. Have fun!
